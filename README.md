# MyBash
................My Bash scripting journey.................

Hey there!! I have created some scripts using the Linux commands I learnt.

You can learn these commands by watching the [learnlinux.tv](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQKHvKbmSzGMvUrVtJYnUA) YouTube videos.

The scripts are organised into two folders:
* Commands
* Scripts

To execute a script:
1. Download the file
2. Open your terminal
3. Type sh file_path/file_name. For example, sh ~/Downloads/MyCmd1

[MyScript 1](MyScript1) - contains commands from 01 video
[MyScript 2](MyScript2) - contains commands from 02, 03 and 04 videos
