# MyBash
My Bash scripting journey

Hey there!! I have created some scripts using the Linux commands I have learnt.

You can learn these commands by watching the [learnlinux.tv](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQKHvKbmSzGMvUrVtJYnUA) YouTube videos.

I have added these two files:
[MyScript 1](MyScript1) - contains commands from 01 video
[MyScript 2](MyScript2) - contains commands from 02, 03 and 04 videos

I think you should describe how users should make use of this scripts
download
execute
and run on Mac using the sh command
