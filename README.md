# MyBash
My Bash scripting journey

Hey there!! I am planning to create a script containing some of the Linux commands I have learnt. 

Let's see how I go.

These commands directly correlate to the videos on learlinux.tv

I have added these two files:
MyScript 1 - contains commands from 01 video
MyScript 2 - contains commands from 02, 03 and 04 videos
