# My Bash Scripting Journey

Hey there!! I have created some scripts using the Linux commands I learnt.

You can learn these commands by watching the [learnlinux.tv](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQKHvKbmSzGMvUrVtJYnUA) YouTube videos.

The scripts are organised into two folders:
* Commands: files in this folder [https://github.com/deeptikorwar/MyBash/tree/master/Commands](Commands) introduce you to some basic commands
* Scripts: files in this folder introduce you to basic scripting

To execute a script:
1. Download the file
2. Open your terminal
3. Type sh file_path/file_name. For example, sh ~/Downloads/MyCmd1
