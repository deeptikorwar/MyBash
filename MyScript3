echo
echo "Well...I do them using the nano command"

echo "I suppose you can do the same using the vi command, but I haven't experimented that yet"
echo
echo "Try nano name_of_file on your terminal"
echo
echo "This creates the file name_of_file in your current working directory"
echo
echo "You can also nano filepath name_of_file to create a file in a particular directory"

echo "Note that if the file already exists, this commands lets you edit the file"
echo
echo "Try out the various options at the bottom of the nano GNU which help you with your file edits"
echo
echo "If you want spaces in your file name, use nano \"name of file\", if you don't use the double quotes, three files are created"
echo "That's right! The files are name, of, and file"
echo
echo "Another important thing, you need to use the escape character \ before double quotes, else they are not outputted."
echo
echo "Happy nano editing"
echo "Until then Asta la Vista"
